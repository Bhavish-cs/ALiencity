🌌 AlienCity Project 🚀 — A Serverless Adventure Begins!

Welcome to AlienCity — a tiny but mighty demo that combines a static website 🌐 with a serverless backend ⚡!
This project shows how easy it is to launch a fully working web app with Zoho Catalyst — deploy it, and BOOM 💥 your site and backend logic are live in the cloud!

🧭 Project Overview

AlienCity is divided into two main parts — think of it like a spaceship with two engines 🚀:

client/ — contains all the static website files (HTML, CSS, JS).
👉 Start exploring from client/index.html.

functions/AlienCityAIO/ — the serverless engine of your project!
This folder has your backend function code (AlienCityAIO.java), configuration (catalyst-config.json), and everything that powers your app’s logic.

⚙️ What Catalyst Does (and Why It’s Awesome)

Zoho Catalyst is your mission control center 🛸 — it handles deployments, hosting, and function execution all in one place.

When you run:

catalyst deploy


Catalyst will:

🚀 Publish your static files from the client/ folder to a public web URL.

🧩 Deploy your serverless functions from functions/ as live endpoints.

🌍 Print out your site and API URLs in the terminal — ready to use instantly.

In short:
Type one command, hit Enter, and BOOM 💥 — your app is live on the internet!


🪐 Final Thoughts

AlienCity is more than a demo — it’s a template for launching your own serverless web app.
With one simple command, your code transforms into a live experience.

So, gear up, type:

catalyst deploy


and watch your serverless city go live — BOOM 💥
Welcome to the future of lightweight, powerful cloud apps. 🌍✨
